# Pyber_Analysis
## Project Overview
Pyber Ride Share Company is in the process of developing their future business model and contracted services to provide insight into their current usage base to better understand opportunites for growth and development.  In order to support this analysis, data is provided in CSV. Data provided contains pertinent information regarding city name and type (Surburban, Rural, and Urban), fares, date & time, ride id, and number of drivers in each city.  

## Analysis 
Datasets will be joined using Python via Jupyter Notebook.  Analysis will be conducted on the full data set but the customer requests that finaly analysis focus on the Jan-April 2019. Addins utilized in
clude Matplotlib, OS, Numpy, and Pandas.

PRSC has requested the following items to be completed:
  * Totals by rides, drivers, and fare by city type
  * Average fare by city type and driver.
  * Visuals to understand weekly fare data by city type.  

## Results
 * The current business model is heavily utilized and operating within the Urban areas.  Usage and total revenue reduces as the ride base moves from Urban to Suburban and again from Suburban to Rural. Although average fare is higher in the Rural areas, total ride volume reduces resulting in lower revenues overall for the Rural areas as shown in the figure below.

Background analyses supporting the revenue stream by City include:
 * Total Rides by City type

 * Total Drivers by City Type

## Summary/Recommendations
 *  While the Urban market is 68% of total revenue, this market is more mature and has multiple ride share sources as competition.  In order to continue to grow in this market, PRSC could look into differentiation within this market segment in order to become/maintain supplier of choice to this community.
 * The rural market represents a challenging environment.  Rides will tend to be longer, fares higher, and usage low. This is a great market to be a driver in based on the fares that can be charged.  It fits well with a part time driver not using this job as a primary source of income due to the limited riders using the service.  Plans from the future should include an assessment of the market in order to make a participate versus exit stragety.  From personal experience, living in a rural area, finding transport for longer distances is hard to come by.  Recommended next steps:
    . Conduct a market assessment to understand the riders, frequency by user, and primary reasons for use.  With this data in hand, insight to determine if this is a segment that can be exploited and grown with a new approach to increase ridership is possible.
    . With the market assessment in hand. Is there a price point that would increase ridership and increase total revenue?  Is there a service that can be included or longer transports provided that will bring the total revenue up in this segment.
    .  If the above 2 do not meet the feasiblity criteria, then either maintain or exit.
 * For the surburban market, it is a solid 30% of the business. This is an area to investigate further.  Is there opportunity to grow the segment? Increase segment ride lengths to increase fares?  Provide transportation for the school age market for parents with known scheduled daily transports that with the waiting time to incentivise drivers to have a somewhat routine daily schedule.
